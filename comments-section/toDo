rather than an if statement, make each section a ternary that changes slightly
depending on if it is currentUser or comments

check if currentUser loop:
    make small changes to certain pieces of component with ternary:
        reply ( should show EDIT/DELETE)
        username (should show YOU)

will need to add comments as well; takes same shape though


add modal when delete btn clicked
